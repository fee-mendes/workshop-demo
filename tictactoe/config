# If deploying to EC2, it is recommended that you leave these blank, and instead deploy credentials through an

[flask]
# This configures flask's secret key, used for encrypting cookies.  If you are running only one flask process / server,
# You can leave this blank and one will be generated randomly at start up.  When you restart, all existing sessions
# will be lost.  Or instead, generate a secret key by running python:
#
# from uuid import uuid4
# print(str(uuid4()))
# 
# secret_key=<random uuid>
#
# Optionally specify the port for flask to listen on
# serverPort=5000
